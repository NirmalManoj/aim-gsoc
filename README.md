# Aim GSoC

This repository contains tasks that are designed to help students become familiar with the process of contributing to an open source organization. It is recommended to watch session #6 before attempting to solve any tasks, and then to look at the issues section of the repository (https://github.com/NirmalManoj/aim-gsoc/issues) to find tasks to work on and learn from.

<!-- In the session, we have covered the following.

**Forking a repository**

Forking a repository is a process that allows users to create a copy of an existing repository under their own account. This allows users to make changes to the code without affecting the original repository, and also makes it easy to submit changes to the original repository through a pull request.

**Creating a branch**

A branch is a way to create a separate version of a repository to work on. When a user creates a new branch, they can make changes to the code without affecting the main branch of the repository. This allows multiple users to work on the same codebase at the same time, and also allows users to submit their changes to the main branch through a pull request.

**Submitting a pull request**

A pull request is a way for users to submit changes they've made to a repository back to the original repository. When a user submits a pull request, the maintainers of the original repository can review the changes and decide whether or not to merge them into the main branch. This allows for collaboration and contributions to open source projects. -->
